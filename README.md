# Barium Human-Machine Interface (HMI)

An innovative software that utilizes neural networks, machine learning, and deep learning for tracking body movements, such as hands, enabling advanced interactions with the operating system, including predefined actions and a virtual mouse. Additionally, the project employs 4D neural network training techniques, where time is one of the dimensions, opening up revolutionary possibilities in various technology fields

## How To Use
Prerequisites
- Python 3.11

Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VitorCarvalho67/Barium.git
```

Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd Barium
```

Create a virtual environment (venv) for the project

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment.
On Windows:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the project's dependencies from requirements.txt.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Software

Make sure your webcam is connected and functional.
In your virtual environment, run the main software script.

```bash
python BariumMouse.py
```
The software should now be active, and you can interact with your computer using hand gestures.

## Develop

In the development process, we start with the creation of a data collection software to build our custom dataset. Next, we move on to developing a neural network, utilizing deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Finally, we create software that employs this network to recognize real-time movements and execute corresponding actions.
